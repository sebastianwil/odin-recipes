    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta 500mg</li>
        <li>Bacon 250mg</li>
        <li>Milk cream 1 cup</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese 250g</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
        <li>Beat the 2 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
        <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
        <li>Mix the cheese with the yolks and then mix it with the pasta, use the pasta cooking water to keep it saucy</li>
        <li>Serve :)</li>
    </ol>
